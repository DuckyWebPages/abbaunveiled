  body = "Knowledge is increasing in the earth, just like Daniel prophesied. Texts, archeological finds and ancient scrolls have never been more available to the common man than is today. Institutional religion has less control over what people believe as people can now research for themselves. Come with us as we explore the idea that Jesus came to reveal a Father, that people had literally never seen or heard before. A Father who was not Yahweh. You have to be open minded and leave your fear and dogma behind, but there is real evidence that the god of this world has blinded even Christians into thinking Yahweh was the Father. Expect research, engaging blog posts, Youtube videos, practices for communion with the Father, and resources that empower seekers.",
