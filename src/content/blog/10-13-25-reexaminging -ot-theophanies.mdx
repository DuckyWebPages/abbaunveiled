  description: "A closer look at so-called Christophanies in the Old Testament through the lens of *The Yahweh Deception*."
excerpt: "Many Christians assume Old-Testament appearances of 'the LORD' were pre-incarnate Jesus. But what if those encounters reveal something—and Someone—else?"

Paul said that “to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart” (2 Corinthians 3:15).  
That veil has kept generations from seeing the distinction between **Yahweh’s delegated rule** and **the Father whom Jesus revealed**.  
One area most affected is the interpretation of **Old Testament theophanies**—moments when “God” visibly appears to humans.

---

### Traditional View
Christian tradition often labels these appearances as **Christophanies**—pre-incarnate visitations of Jesus.  
They seem to make sense of verses where a visible “LORD” speaks face-to-face with people before Bethlehem.

Yet, when we re-examine them through the revelation of **El Elyon**, the Father above all, the pattern shifts dramatically.

### 1. The Angel of the LORD Episodes
*Genesis 16 (Hagar), 22 (Abraham), Exodus 3 (Moses), Numbers 22 (Balaam), Judges 6 (Gideon), Judges 13 (Samson’s parents)*  

> **Traditional reading:** Jesus appears temporarily as “the LORD.”  
> **Yahweh Deception lens:** these are manifestations of **Yahweh or his proxy angel**, functioning within the *law-based administrative system* later confronted by Christ. They carry legal authority, not the relational heart of the Father.

### 2. Sinai and the Giving of the Law
Thunder, smoke, fire, and strict boundaries mark Sinai (Ex 19–34).  
This is **Yahweh’s domain**—the covenant of law and fear.  
Jesus did not appear there; He came centuries later to **replace that system** with a Melchizedek, relationship-based priesthood.

---

### 3. Jacob Wrestling “God” (Genesis 32)
Jacob’s night encounter transfers covenantal authority.  
Rather than a tender Father-Son moment, it is a **legal transaction**—consistent with Yahweh’s governance, not El Elyon’s nature.

---

### 4. The Commander of the Host (Joshua 5:13-15)
Sword drawn, commanding holy war—this being reflects **Yahweh’s militarized hierarchy**.  
The scene prefigures the very kind of dominion Jesus later refuses when He tells Peter to put away the sword.

---

### 5. Melchizedek (Genesis 14; Psalm 110; Hebrews 7)
The sole figure who *does* foreshadow Christ: king of Salem, priest of **El Elyon**, offering **bread and wine**, blessing rather than commanding.  
Melchizedek models the priesthood Jesus restores—a covenant of life, not law.

---

### 6. Patriarchal “Appearances of the LORD”
When Genesis says “YHWH appeared,” we’re often reading **later redactions** that replaced older names like *El Shaddai* or *El Elyon* with *YHWH*.  
Early encounters likely involved **El Elyon**, but scribal harmonization merged them into Yahweh’s story.

---

### The Veil and the Revelation
Theophanies that once looked like pre-incarnate Christ now reveal the **contrast** between two administrations:
- **Yahweh’s**—legal, territorial, coercive.  
- **El Elyon’s**—relational, restorative, revealed in Jesus.

Removing the veil means recognizing which is which—and letting the fruit of each system expose its source.
