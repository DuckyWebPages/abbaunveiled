## Jesus Must Be the Lens We View the Old Testament God Through  

### Jesus as the Lens  
Jesus is the lens through which we must view the Father. He said:  

- *“He who has seen Me has seen the Father.”* (John 14:9)  
- *“I and My Father are one.”* (John 10:30)  
- *“He is the image of the invisible God.”* (Colossians 1:15)  

Jesus does not reflect a partial image of the Father – He reveals the Father perfectly. His love, kindness, healing, and truth are the full disclosure of the Father's nature.  

When we read the Old Testament through the lens of Jesus' character, we begin to notice profound inconsistencies between Jesus’ revelation of the Father and some of the depictions of God in the Old Testament – particularly acts of legalism, wrath, genocide, and violence. These contradictions force us to ask: Have we misidentified who the Father truly is?

### You Will Know Them by Their Fruits  
Jesus gave us a clear and practical standard for discernment: *“You will know them by their fruits”* (Matthew 7:16, 20). In this passage, He warns us to watch out for false prophets—those who appear righteous on the outside but produce corrupt results. He goes on to explain that a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.  

This principle isn’t just about people; it’s about evaluating the spiritual origin of any voice, doctrine, or system. The fruit test is a divine filter—meant to help us distinguish what is truly from the Father and what only claims to be.  

This standard is especially important when assessing the character of Yahweh in the Old Testament. If Yahweh's actions include commanding genocide, condoning slavery, killing children, and enforcing a law system that leads to death—then the fruit of that tree must be questioned.  

Some say we shouldn’t apply the “fruit test” to God because *“God is not a prophet.”* There are two flaws with this thought. First, this assumes that the character of Yahweh is unquestionably God—even when the fruit contradicts Jesus. It assumes God’s actions are justified simply because He is God, not because they reflect His nature.  

Secondly, Jesus invites us to test His identity based on His actions—not on religious assumptions or inherited doctrines:  

> *“If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.”* (John 10:37–38, NKJV)  

Jesus never told us to make exceptions for “divine violence.” He told us to look at the fruit. If we ignore His standard when the behavior gets uncomfortable, then we are not being faithful to Jesus—we are being loyal to tradition.

### Theological Crossroads  
If we continue to excuse violence, cruelty, and unjust systems simply because they’re labeled “God” in Scripture, we risk being deceived. What if the being called Yahweh wasn’t God at all—but an angel? Or worse, a fallen one? And then his own scribes erased the name *El Elyon* from texts and wrote in “Yahweh”—conflating the two names into the same being? (Scholars agree this editing happened!)  

The fruit test matters, because not every voice claiming divine authority actually represents the Father Jesus came to reveal.  

In contrast, Jesus, who is the express image of the Father (Hebrews 1:3), never once brought death or destruction. He healed the sick, forgave sinners, fed the hungry, and restored life. By Jesus’s own standard, the Father He reveals should bear the same kind of fruit.  

If the fruit of Yahweh’s system does not match the fruit of Jesus’s life, then we are faced with a theological crossroads: either Jesus misrepresents the Father, or Yahweh was never the Father to begin with.
