I asked Chat GPT what most Evangelical Christians think about Constantine. This was the reply:

The General Evangelical View

Positive Turning Point: Many evangelicals see Constantine as the Roman emperor who ended persecution against Christians (Edict of Milan, 313 AD). He’s often credited with allowing Christianity to flourish openly after centuries of oppression.

Providence of God: They tend to frame his reign as God using a pagan emperor to advance His kingdom. The idea is that God works through imperfect leaders, and Constantine’s acceptance of Christianity was part of God’s plan.

Council of Nicaea: They know Constantine convened it (325 AD) to resolve disputes like Arianism. The Nicene Creed is celebrated as a defense of Jesus’ divinity, so Constantine is indirectly appreciated for that role.

What Evangelicals Typically Don’t Focus On

Political Motives: Few sermons or evangelical books go deep into how Constantine used Christianity to unify the empire. That’s more a scholarly or “church history buff” angle.

Pagan Blending: Evangelicals usually don’t emphasize how much pagan Roman culture bled into Christian practice (e.g., sun worship symbols, Sol Invictus parallels, or state power fused with church). Some fringe evangelical voices do talk about it, but it’s not mainstream pulpit material.

Imperial Church Corruption: Protestants often locate “the corruption of the church” later, with the rise of medieval Catholicism, indulgences, etc.—not directly with Constantine.

Nuanced Evangelical Takes

Heroes vs. Caution: You’ll sometimes hear, “God used Constantine, but state power and faith don’t mix well.” This comes up when evangelicals critique “state churches” or the idea of America being a “Christian nation.”

Church History Courses: Evangelicals who study patristics or church history will often acknowledge Constantine both as a turning point and as the start of “Christendom”—which some see as a blessing (Christian influence on law and culture) and others as a curse (political co-opting of faith).

### Further Resources
If you’d like to dig deeper into the life and contradictions of Emperor Constantine, I recommend checking out a discussion by modern-day scholar **M. David Litwa**.  

👉 [Watch the video here](https://www.patreon.com/mdavidlitwa)  

Litwa highlights how Constantine, though professing Christianity, committed shocking acts of violence:  
- He killed his imperial father-in-law, brother-in-law, biological son, and probably even his wife.  
- He eliminated an imperial colleague, another brother-in-law, and his young nephew.  
- He persecuted Christian minorities.  
- He destroyed Greek temples and prohibited sacrifices.  
- Yet, he welcomed personal veneration—allowing people to praise him and honor his statues.  

Constantine also **politically shaped Christianity**:  
- He was the first politician to declare **Sunday a public holiday**.  
- He offered **tax benefits to churches**, linking faith and state power in a new way.  

This mix of faith, violence, and politics is why Constantine remains such a controversial figure in church history.

I think it is high time to reconsider the organized church throughout history as being organized in order to control Christianity - something Satan/Helel would have been doing as he created the Beast System of Law and moved it out through Rome and then Europe to the whole world.
