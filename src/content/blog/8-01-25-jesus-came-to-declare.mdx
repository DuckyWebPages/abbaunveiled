Jesus Came to Declare the Father

*And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.* (John 17:26)
*And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.* (John 5:37)
*No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.* (John 1:18)
*Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.’* (John 14:6-7) 
Jesus came for many reasons – to heal, to rescue, to bring freedom, and ultimately to give His life for us. But at the heart of it all, He came to reveal the Father. Not simply to confirm what people already believed about God, but to introduce them to someone they had never truly known. Religious teaching has veiled this.
When Jesus said, *“If you’ve seen Me, you’ve seen the Father,”* He wasn’t using a metaphor. He meant it. His miracles, His compassion, His kindness – all of it was a living picture of who the Father really is. And that is not who Yahweh was.
