## Jesus Came to Declare the Father

### Key Scriptures (NKJV)
- “And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.” (John 17:26)
- “And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.” (John 5:37)
- “No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” (John 1:18)
- “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.” (John 14:6–7)

### Not Clarifying a Misunderstood Yahweh
Jesus did not arrive to soften a deity people already knew; He came to **declare the Father**. He says the Father had not been seen or heard by His audience (John 5:37; 6:46). That’s not clarification—it’s revelation.

### What “Name” Means
In Scripture, *name* speaks to **nature and character**. When Jesus says He declared the Father’s *name*, He means He revealed the Father’s **heart**—mercy, healing, truth, covenant love. He is “the image of the invisible God” (Colossians 1:15) and “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (John 14:9).

### The Father Revealed in the Son
Jesus fulfilled the law and the prophets, yet His mission was to end their **rule over us** and reconcile us to the Father. Ransoms are set by **captors**, not by loving parents; the cross breaks the legal claim of the accuser, not the love of the Father. He forgave **before** sacrifice (Mark 2:5; Luke 23:34), showing that the Father’s mercy is not constrained by ritual blood.

### Takeaway
Measure every “god-concept” by the life and works of Jesus. If the fruit doesn’t match the Son, it doesn’t match the Father. Jesus didn’t reveal a different mood of the same being—He **declared the Father**.
