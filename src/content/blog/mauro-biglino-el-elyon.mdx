When we open Genesis 14, we encounter one of the most mysterious figures in the Bible: **Melchizedek, king of Salem**. The text tells us he brought out bread and wine and was *“Cohen of El Elyon.”*

### El Elyon as “The One Above”
Italian scholar Mauro Biglino emphasizes that *El Elyon* is not a personal name like “Yahweh,” but a title.  
- *El* simply means “god.”  
- *Elyon* means “high,” “uppermost,” or “the one above.”  

Together, *El Elyon* describes **“the god who is above all others.”** It’s an epithet, not a proper name. In this reading, Melchizedek was aligned with the highest god — distinct from Yahweh.

### Melchizedek: Priest of Elyon
The Hebrew says Melchizedek was *kōhēn le-’El Elyon* — “priest of El Elyon.”  
- *Cohen* means priest, but also mediator or representative.  
- This priesthood was not Levitical and not tied to Yahweh’s temple system.  
- Instead, it suggests an **older priesthood under a different divine authority.**

And notice the distinctive sign: **bread and wine.** Unlike the bloody sacrifices that came later under the Levitical priesthood, Melchizedek’s offering was relational, nourishing, and communal. It was about fellowship, not appeasement. 

### Jesus and the Priesthood of Melchizedek
The New Testament repeatedly declares that Jesus is a priest *“in the order of Melchizedek”* (Hebrews 7:17). What does that mean?  

- Jesus did not align Himself with the Levitical system of law and sacrifice.  
- Instead, He connected to **Melchizedek’s priesthood of El Elyon — the one above.**  
- His central act was breaking bread and sharing wine, instituting communion.  

This is no accident. Jesus was deliberately echoing Melchizedek. He was pointing to a priesthood founded on **relationship, communion, and direct access to the Father** — not on ritual sacrifice or legal systems.  

### Why It Matters
If Biglino is right that *Elyon* is “the one above,” then Genesis 14 and the New Testament both testify to a priesthood outside of Yahweh’s system. Melchizedek and Jesus stand together as representatives of a **higher order**, one built on intimacy with the Most High rather than submission to legalistic structures.

I will make a note here that Biglino doesn't say that El Elyon is or is not the Father Jesus reveals. And, in his world view, El Elyon may or may not just be another god in charge of the lesser gods. I don't want to misrepresent any scholar and respect Mauro deeply. We all touch a different part of the elephant and have a little different view point, and that is okay.

I have had a very personal relationship with Yeshua and now His Father, "Abba" whom He has introduced me to. There is still so much to learn through both academics and experience, and I will say even personal revelation. Why personal revelation? Because Yeshua and His Father are real entities with real personalities, and if you believe they are alive and interpersonal today, would you deny them interpersonal relationship and fellowship with those who follow them? No, most people would not. If the academics can cross over their logical brain to the heart, and the heart-led people can cross over to academics... somewhere in there is a balance where we can reseach and learn more information as "knowledge increases in the earth" and our hearts connect and communicate through spirit with Yeshua and Abba.

There are still so many questions. And, I say it is okay to not have all the answers. Here is a video of Mauro discussing some of this content: https://youtu.be/_BohuXUx0yI?si=njPFiVcBfD1voFiK. 

So the question becomes: when Jesus aligned Himself with Melchizedek, was He signaling that the true Father He came to reveal was El Elyon — *the One Above*?
