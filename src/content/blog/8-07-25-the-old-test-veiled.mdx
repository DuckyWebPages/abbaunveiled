The Old Testament is Veiled
By WR Selvig
Excerpt From *The Yahweh Deception*

Many believers claim they see Jesus throughout the Old Testament. They say, “The veil is lifted—I see Christ in every book!” And to a degree, that’s true. When we’re in Christ, we begin to see glimpses of Him everywhere. Many sincere believers see Jesus in the Old Testament, and I don’t dispute that. I see Him there too—but I see Him emerging, interrupting, and ultimately correcting the system we inherited.
But we should ask a deeper question: Are we truly seeing Jesus—the One who reveals the Father of love, grace, and mercy—or are we projecting Jesus and His Father onto passages that may reflect a very different voice and character? 
Paul warned that when people read the Old Testament, a veil remains over their minds. They are unable to discern truth:
But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. (2 Corinthians 3:14-16)
What does it mean to be veiled? According to the Collins English Dictionary, a veil hides or disguises something, making it difficult to see clearly.
Paul is describing a kind of spiritual blindness—not just ignorance, but a dulled perception. And the danger is subtle: we can read the Old Testament, even with decades of Christian experience, and still misidentify the voice of the Father if we don’t let Jesus reinterpret it for us.
The veil Paul mentions is not automatically removed just because we’ve been Christians a long time. It’s removed when we intentionally allow Jesus—not tradition, not doctrine—to become the lens through which we read the Scripture. Without that lens, we risk confusing the God Jesus revealed with another voice entirely.
It’s like spotting counterfeit money—you won’t recognize the fake unless you’ve studied the real thing. Jesus says if we have seen Him, we’ve seen the Father. He has to be the filter – His character, His words. 
Veiled scripture is like counterfeit money: unless we’ve soaked in the words, actions, and heart of Jesus, we might not notice when another character speaks in God’s name.


The New Testament is Blurred
When Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek (3rd–2nd century BC), Theos  was used to translate the words El and Elohim—and Yahweh.
This contributed to the blurring of divine identities over time. The Septuagint was created for the Greek-speaking Jewish diaspora , who could no longer read Hebrew fluently but still wanted access to the Scriptures. In the Septuagint, readers saw the word Theos, whether it originally referred to El Elyon or Yahweh, masking the distinction Jesus later came to reveal.
Language, Transmission, and Theological Influence
This is important to understand, because many modern Messianic and Hebrew Roots movements quote from Hebrew versions of the New Testament to suggest that Jesus used the name Yahweh. But these Hebrew manuscripts were not written during Jesus’ time—they were produced centuries later by Jewish scribes. These scribes were intensely loyal to Yahweh, not to the Father Jesus revealed. Would we trust a modern cult to rewrite the New Testament with their god’s name inserted? Probably not. And yet, that is effectively what has happened here. After examining redactions in the Hebrew Scriptures, it’s essential to address another foundational issue: the linguistic and cultural transmission of the New Testament and how this affects our understanding of Jesus and the Father He revealed.
The New Testament was written in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Roman Empire during the first century. Jesus, however, spoke Aramaic—a Semitic language closely related to Hebrew, but distinct in grammar, vocabulary, and cultural nuance. What this means is that everything we read in the New Testament is already one step removed from Jesus’ original spoken words, filtered through the Greek language and Greco-Roman literary structure.
Fast forward several centuries, and a curious phenomenon occurs: Hebrew translations of the New Testament begin to appear, but not until at least the 9th to 14th centuries AD, well after the close of the canon. These versions were produced by Jewish scribes—often working from existing Greek or Latin manuscripts—and were not original sources. In fact, they represent a backward reconstruction of Jesus' words into a language He spoke, but from a perspective that often reflected the theology of Judaism, not the Kingdom message of Jesus.
This matters. The Hebrew New Testament is not ancient—it is interpreted, filtered, and often infused with theological choices made by scribes whose own religious commitments were to Yahweh, not to Jesus as the image of El Elyon. When modern readers use these Hebrew New Testaments to "prove" that Jesus used Yahweh's name or referenced Jehovah, they are, perhaps unknowingly, relying on later reconstructions written by adherents of a system Jesus repeatedly contradicted.
To put it plainly: If these same scribes were members of a rival religious cult, we would rightly be skeptical of their edits. Yet because their work comes with the linguistic badge of “Hebrew,” it often gets a pass. But language doesn’t sanctify doctrine—and translation doesn’t guarantee fidelity to the original speaker’s intent. The very people who rejected Jesus as Messiah should not be considered neutral editors of His words.
Thus, we must return to the lens of Jesus Himself. If the redacted Hebrew New Testament reintroduces Yahweh as “the Father,” we are obligated to ask: Is this the voice of Jesus we are hearing, or is it a retroactive attempt to harmonize His words with a deity He came to replace?
