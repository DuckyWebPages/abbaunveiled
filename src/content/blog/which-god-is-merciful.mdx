# **Which God Is Truly Merciful? Jesus vs. Yahweh**

For centuries, Christians have assumed that the merciful Father Jesus revealed is the same deity Israel knew as Yahweh. But is that true? When we place the words of Jesus side by side with the Old Testament descriptions of Yahweh, a stark contrast appears.  

## 🌿 Jesus on the Father’s Mercy  
When Jesus spoke of His Father, mercy was not an afterthought. It was the essence of who Abba is:  

- **Mercy to enemies.** “Love your enemies… that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:44–45, NKJV)  
- **Mercy without limits.** “Be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.” (Luke 6:36, NKJV)  
- **Mercy instead of condemnation.** “For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” (John 3:17, NKJV)  
- **Mercy without payment.** In the parable of the prodigal son, the Father restores the wayward son without sacrifice, without ritual, without blood—only with embrace and a feast (Luke 15:20–24).  

In Jesus’ teaching, mercy flows freely. It is relational, unconditional, and available even to those who hate or reject Him.  

## 🕎 Yahweh on Mercy  
Now compare that with the Old Testament declarations of Yahweh’s “mercy.”  

- **Exodus 34:6–7** – “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious… keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty.”  
- **Deuteronomy 4:31** – “For the Lord your God is a merciful God, He will not forsake you… nor forget the covenant of your fathers.”  
- **Nehemiah 9:31** – “Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them; for You are God, gracious and merciful.”  
- **Psalm 103:8** – “The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.”  
- **Joel 2:13** – “Return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; and He relents from doing harm.”  

At first glance, it looks similar. But look closely: Yahweh’s mercy is always tied to **conditions**—covenant loyalty, repentance, ritual sacrifice. Mercy is framed not as the Father’s nature, but as the withholding of wrath when people return to obedience.  

## ✍️ The Redaction Question  
Even more telling: these “Yahweh is merciful” verses are almost all repetitions of the same formula first recorded in Exodus 34. Scholars widely recognize this phrase—“merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in mercy”—as a **redactional refrain** inserted into multiple books (Nehemiah, Joel, Psalms) by later scribes to soften Yahweh’s harsher image.  

In other words, this wasn’t the spontaneous voice of God—it was an editorial gloss. A theological attempt to balance Yahweh’s violence with a hint of compassion. The true Father didn’t need to be “balanced.” Jesus showed us what the Father is actually like.  

## ✨ The Difference  
- **Yahweh’s mercy:** conditional, covenant-bound, often redacted into the text.  
- **Abba’s mercy:** unconditional, relational, and revealed perfectly in Jesus.  

When Jesus said, “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:36), He was drawing a line in the sand. The Father’s mercy is not about holding back wrath when you’ve repented enough. It is radical kindness to the unthankful and evil.  

## ✅ Conclusion  
If we’re going to believe anyone about the character of God, we should believe Jesus. Yahweh’s “mercy” may have been a scribal attempt to temper a terrifying deity. But Abba’s mercy is revealed in Jesus without condition, without sacrifice, without redaction.  

**I believe Jesus when He describes the Father.**
