# **Which God Is Truly Merciful? Jesus vs. Yahweh**

For centuries, Christians have assumed that the merciful Father Jesus revealed is the same deity Israel knew as Yahweh. But is that true? When we place the words of Jesus side by side with the Old Testament descriptions of Yahweh, a stark contrast appears.  

## ðŸŒ¿ Jesus on the Fatherâ€™s Mercy  
When Jesus spoke of His Father, mercy was not an afterthought. It was the essence of who Abba is:  

- **Mercy to enemies.** â€œLove your enemiesâ€¦ that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.â€ (Matthew 5:44â€“45, NKJV)  
- **Mercy without limits.** â€œBe merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.â€ (Luke 6:36, NKJV)  
- **Mercy instead of condemnation.** â€œFor God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.â€ (John 3:17, NKJV)  
- **Mercy without payment.** In the parable of the prodigal son, the Father restores the wayward son without sacrifice, without ritual, without bloodâ€”only with embrace and a feast (Luke 15:20â€“24).  

In Jesusâ€™ teaching, mercy flows freely. It is relational, unconditional, and available even to those who hate or reject Him.  

## ðŸ•Ž Yahweh on Mercy  
Now compare that with the Old Testament declarations of Yahwehâ€™s â€œmercy.â€  

- **Exodus 34:6â€“7** â€“ â€œThe Lord, the Lord God, merciful and graciousâ€¦ keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty.â€  
- **Deuteronomy 4:31** â€“ â€œFor the Lord your God is a merciful God, He will not forsake youâ€¦ nor forget the covenant of your fathers.â€  
- **Nehemiah 9:31** â€“ â€œNevertheless in Your great mercy You did not utterly consume them nor forsake them; for You are God, gracious and merciful.â€  
- **Psalm 103:8** â€“ â€œThe Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.â€  
- **Joel 2:13** â€“ â€œReturn to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; and He relents from doing harm.â€  

At first glance, it looks similar. But look closely: Yahwehâ€™s mercy is always tied to **conditions**â€”covenant loyalty, repentance, ritual sacrifice. Mercy is framed not as the Fatherâ€™s nature, but as the withholding of wrath when people return to obedience.  

## âœï¸ The Redaction Question  
Even more telling: these â€œYahweh is mercifulâ€ verses are almost all repetitions of the same formula first recorded in Exodus 34. Scholars widely recognize this phraseâ€”â€œmerciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in mercyâ€â€”as a **redactional refrain** inserted into multiple books (Nehemiah, Joel, Psalms) by later scribes to soften Yahwehâ€™s harsher image.  

In other words, this wasnâ€™t the spontaneous voice of Godâ€”it was an editorial gloss. A theological attempt to balance Yahwehâ€™s violence with a hint of compassion. The true Father didnâ€™t need to be â€œbalanced.â€ Jesus showed us what the Father is actually like.  

## âœ¨ The Difference  
- **Yahwehâ€™s mercy:** conditional, covenant-bound, often redacted into the text.  
- **Abbaâ€™s mercy:** unconditional, relational, and revealed perfectly in Jesus.  

When Jesus said, â€œBe merciful, just as your Father is mercifulâ€ (Luke 6:36), He was drawing a line in the sand. The Fatherâ€™s mercy is not about holding back wrath when youâ€™ve repented enough. It is radical kindness to the unthankful and evil.  

## âœ… Conclusion  
If weâ€™re going to believe anyone about the character of God, we should believe Jesus. Yahwehâ€™s â€œmercyâ€ may have been a scribal attempt to temper a terrifying deity. But Abbaâ€™s mercy is revealed in Jesus without condition, without sacrifice, without redaction.  

**I believe Jesus when He describes the Father.**
