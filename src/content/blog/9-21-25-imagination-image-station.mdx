We’re told from childhood that the imagination is make-believe—cute for kids, useless for reality. I believe that’s a lie designed to keep you from spirit realm growth. We were made “in His image,” and the Father is a Creator. Creation in our lives starts the same way creation began in Genesis: with a seen-by-the-spirit picture before it manifests in the natural. “For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”(2 Corinthians 4:18 NKJV)

## 1) Imagination isn’t pretend; it’s pre-creation
The word *imagination* is rooted in *image*. I like to call my imgaination my "image-station". In your inner image-station, you can see what isn’t yet physical. Designers do this instinctively: a table, a flower arrangement, a room layout—first you **see** it. Whether you ever build it or not, the image is real in the inner world and is the seed of manifestation. “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”(Hebrews 11:1 NKJV)

## 2) Body • Soul • Spirit—and the “image-station”
You are body, soul (mind/will/emotions), and spirit. The spirit realm communicates through pictures and impressions that render on your mind’s screen—the imagination. Just think, the language of pictures is universal. The spirit-realm is universal. And, supposedly a picture is worth a thousand words, so it does make sense that spirit communication is done in pictures. This means you are created with this spirit-language interpreter and communicator within you. If you accept the world’s verdict that imagination “isn’t real,” you’ll dismiss the channel Heaven often uses to speak. “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”(John 4:24 NKJV)

## 3) Dreams ride the same highway
At night, dreams arrive through the same image-station. Some are noise - the brain's working out and filing of information received; some are direct spiritual communication (Joel 2:28). Heaven has used dreams to communicate with people for ages. Steward your dreams. If you sense they are more than last night's pizza, ask Heaven for an interpretaion and be on the lookout for it. The Spirit of God will guide you. If you feel tormented in your dreams, you may need to take a moment of consecration:

**Activation: Title & Deed of the Imagination**  
> Jesus, I bring my imagination to Your courts. I repent for images I’ve invited that defile or distract. I renounce my previous lack of faith in the powerful tool of the imagination. I renounce and reject all interlopers and ask for angels to come and remove them. I give You Jesus legal title to this image-station. Write Your name over it. Wash it with Your Spirit and make it holy. Amen.

## 4) Seeing in the spirit (practice grows sight)
When you pray, step into Heaven by faith. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you where you are and what He’s doing. Let the first gentle pictures come without forcing them. Don’t rush to analyze; receive and respond. Faith sharpens sight. Over time your inner “eyes” adjust: “the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.”(Ephesians 1:18 NKJV) Practice makes better sight. Over time your ability to see details and to see better develop.

**Simple practice**
- Breathe, focus on Jesus, and invite the Spirit to lead.
- Ask one question: *Father, what are You doing right now? What do you have for me today?*
- Note the first image or impression. Thank Him and agree with what He may show you.
- If any steps need to be taken, act on what you discern.

## 5) Why the enemy trashes imagination
If the enemy wanted to stop sons and daughters from creating with God, he’d discredit the tool that launches creation. He’d label imagination as childish, untrustworthy, or “just you.” Resist that narrative. You were made to image the Father (Genesis 1:26).

## 6) Children often perceive more
Kids haven’t learned to shut off the image-station. Don’t dismiss a child’s perception as “just an active imagination.” Instead, help them test fruit, bless what’s from God, and gently redirect what’s not. Often, it’s our adult imaginations that have been dampened.

## 7) Build holy spaces with Him
Your imagination hosts a secret place where you meet with the Father, Yeshua, and the Holy Spirit. You can co-create simple rooms, gardens, or tables of fellowship in your inner world. These aren’t escapes; they’re training grounds for obedience in the natural. Start small; meet Him consistently.

### Prayer & Repentance Checklist
- ❑ I renounce images I’ve invited that oppose the Spirit (shows, fantasies, fear-loops).  
- ❑ I forgive myself for past misuse of imagination.  
- ❑ Jesus, cleanse my image-station and mark it “Holy to the Lord.”  
- ❑ Holy Spirit, train my sight for love, intercession, and building with You.

### Imagination Tune-Up
1. Consecrate the image-station (prayer above).  
2. Step into the Court of Titles and Deeds and ask that the deed to your imagination be given over to Jesus.  
3. Journal a dream; ask the Lord for one line of meaning.  
4. Step into Heaven and ask to meet with the Spirit of Wisdom (One of the 7 Spirits of God). Ask her for wisdom for a specific area or situation in your life. Journal any impression or words you hear. 
5. Design with God—something practical (room, schedule, habit).  
6. Intercede: *What are You doing in my city?* Agree in prayer.  
7. By faith, create a place within you where you can meet with the Father, Jesus and the Spirits of God. Choose an atmosphere (beach, woods, mountains, by a stream, etc) and then see a cabin, a tent, a house, or whatever you want to create that is yours to share with the Lord. Spend time creating the details for your mind to see. Return to this place regularly and invite the Father to meet with you. There are several exercises printed in section II of the book, The Yahweh Deception that walk you through creating spaces like this. You can also go to the podcast on this website and listen to the first three episodes which are audible narrations to help you create spaces.

You were born to image the Father. Guard your imagination, give it to Jesus, and use it—daily—as Heaven’s interface for hearing, creating, and obeying.
