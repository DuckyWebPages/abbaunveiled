We’re told from childhood that the imagination is make-believe—cute for kids, useless for reality. I believe that’s a lie designed to keep you from spirit realm growth. We were made “in His image,” and the Father is a Creator. Creation in our lives starts the same way creation began in Genesis: with a seen-by-the-spirit picture before it manifests in the natural. “For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”(2 Corinthians 4:18 NKJV)

## 1) Imagination isn’t pretend; it’s pre-creation
The word *imagination* is rooted in *image*. In your inner image-station, you can see what isn’t yet physical. Designers do this instinctively: a table, a flower arrangement, a room layout—first you **see** it. Whether you ever build it or not, the image is real in the inner world and is the seed of manifestation. “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”(Hebrews 11:1 NKJV)

## 2) Body • Soul • Spirit—and the “image-station”
You are body, soul (mind/will/emotions), and spirit. The spirit realm communicates through pictures and impressions that render on your mind’s screen—the imagination. If you accept the world’s verdict that imagination “isn’t real,” you’ll dismiss the channel Heaven often uses to speak. “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”(John 4:24 NKJV)

## 3) Dreams ride the same highway
At night, dreams arrive through the same image-station. Some are noise; some are direct spiritual communication (Joel 2:28). Steward it. If needed, take a moment of consecration:

**Activation: Title & Deed of the Imagination**  
> Jesus, I bring my imagination to Your courts. I repent for images I’ve invited that defile or distract. I renounce interlopers and give You legal title to this image-station. Write Your name over it. Wash it with Your Spirit and make it holy to the Lord. Amen.

## 4) Seeing in the spirit (practice grows sight)
When you pray, step into Heaven by faith. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you where you are and what He’s doing. Let the first gentle pictures come without forcing them. Don’t rush to analyze; receive and respond. Faith sharpens sight. Over time your inner “eyes” adjust: “the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.”(Ephesians 1:18 NKJV)

**Simple practice**
- Breathe, focus on Jesus, and invite the Spirit to lead.
- Ask one question: *Father, what are You doing right now?*
- Note the first image or impression. Thank Him and ask, *How do I agree with this today?*
- Act on the smallest obedient step.

## 5) Why the enemy trashes imagination
If the enemy wanted to stop sons and daughters from creating with God, he’d discredit the tool that launches creation. He’d label imagination as childish, untrustworthy, or “just you.” Resist that narrative. You were made to image the Father (Genesis 1:26).

## 6) Children often perceive more
Kids haven’t learned to shut off the image-station. Don’t dismiss a child’s perception as “just an active imagination.” Instead, help them test fruit, bless what’s from God, and gently redirect what’s not. Often, it’s our adult imaginations that have been dampened.

## 7) Build holy spaces with Him
Your imagination hosts a secret place where you meet with the Father, Yeshua, and the Holy Spirit. You can co-create simple rooms, gardens, or tables of fellowship in your inner world. These aren’t escapes; they’re training grounds for obedience in the natural. Start small; meet Him consistently.

### Prayer & Repentance Checklist
- ❑ I renounce images I’ve invited that oppose the Spirit (shows, fantasies, fear-loops).  
- ❑ I forgive myself for past misuse of imagination.  
- ❑ Jesus, cleanse my image-station and mark it “Holy to the Lord.”  
- ❑ Holy Spirit, train my sight for love, intercession, and building with You.

### 7-Day Imagination Tune-Up
1. **Day 1:** Consecrate the image-station (prayer above).  
2. **Day 2:** Ask for one picture for someone you love; act in kindness.  
3. **Day 3:** Journal a dream; ask the Lord for one line of meaning.  
4. **Day 4:** Sit with a verse; let the Spirit “paint” it (lectio + visio).  
5. **Day 5:** Design with God—something practical (room, schedule, habit).  
6. **Day 6:** Intercede: *What are You building in my city?* Agree in prayer.  
7. **Day 7:** Review your week; note patterns, peace, and next steps.

You were born to image the Father. Guard your imagination, give it to Jesus, and use it—daily—as Heaven’s interface for hearing, creating, and obeying.
