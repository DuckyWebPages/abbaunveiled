Why do I believe so strongly in a resurrected Christ and in a loving heavenly Father?  

Because my whole life has been marked by His presence, His miracles, and His guidance. This is not theory for me—it has been lived experience.  And though I have a short space to include a lot of experiences, I want to give an overview here for people who are wanting to know who I am and what I stand for.

## A Childhood of Faith and Miracles  

I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior when I was ten years old. Even as a child, I was what some would call a *seer*. I could perceive the spiritual world and see pictures in my mind’s eye of Jesus. I talked to Him, and He talked back.  I could see vivid things in the spirit realm, and my parents thought I just had an active imagination. They were not believers and got divorced when I was five. There was a lot of early heartbreak and brokenness in my early years but I learned that Jesus was with Me and He strengthened me.

Miracles began early. I had great faith as a child. I saw a stye on my eye disappear after I spoke to it in the name of Jesus. Instantly. It was just gone. Later, an incurable skin disease, **Pityriasis Rosea**, left my body instantly after I commanded it in Jesus’ name to go. The heat vanished, the itching stopped, and within days my skin was completely healed. Little things like this happened often and I knew that the spirit realm was real, that we lived blindly in a physical world, but there was so much more. And, Jesus apparently had authority because when I called on Him and spoke to things in His name, changes in the earth realm happened.

## My Brother’s Radical Encounter  

My older brother’s story strengthened my faith. At eighteen, he ended up in jail, accused of stealing gas. Alone in a cell, he cried out: “God, if You’re real, get me out of here and I’ll serve You.”  

That very day, a local minister—whom he had never met—walked into his cell and said, *“Come on boy, God told me to come get you out of jail.”*  

From that moment on, my brother walked in radical faith, and I had a partner in believing, even through our parents’ divorce and trials.  He became a youth pastor and later head pastor and then missionary. He has always walked in faith and encouraged me as well.

## Wrestling with Religion in School  

In middle and high school, I led worship in my youth group, was very active in youth ministry and Bible studies for my high school. Later, I chose a Christian college without knowing that it was **cessationist**—the teaching that the Holy Spirit no longer works miracles today. I clashed constantly with professors and friends there, refusing to deny the reality I had lived.  

I transferred to **Oral Roberts University**, where I completed my degree. This school was the opposite extreme in views on the Holy Spirit, where I was taught to hear the voice of Jesus daily. It was here that I realized hearing God wasn’t just my intuition. He guided me, encouraged me, and revealed secrets that could not have been known through intuition alone. For example, I was the chaplain for my dorm floor and was praying over the door of one of the girls. I heard the Lord say to me, "She has gotten into pornography and is meeting men in chatrooms online. She is in danger." About a week later she knocked on my door and came to talk. She told me (without me mentioning what the Holy Spirit had shown me) that indeed she had been meeting men in chat rooms and was considering meeting them in person." This was not intuition, I didn't know anything about this girl or couldn't have guessed it. This was relational knowledge from the spirit realm and it came from knowing Jesus.

This is when I learned: *we are never alone to figure life out*.  You don't have to walk life alone. You can invite Jesus to walk with you and He will. He will be your counselor and guide.

## Family, Business, and Missions  

After graduating and marrying my best friend Erik, we moved to Colorado, raised children, built businesses, and poured ourselves into life. Raising three boys has been my greatest calling, shaping them into stable young men.  

We also spent **two years as missionaries in Panama**, helping build a ministry farm and serving refugees.  This was a life-changing experience, seeing God provide in personal, miraculous ways.

## Miracles in Missions  

One day, we prepared food for 50 new refugee arrivals as that is how many we had been told was coming. These people were hungry and many had been trafficked and abused. The bus unloaded **300 people**. We served what we had anyway. Plate after plate went out, and somehow, everyone was fed—and there was food left over. It was a modern-day loaves-and-fishes miracle.  We served probably 7-8 times the amount of food that we had brought! Walking in faith and seeing God provide like this was life-changing.

## Miracles on the Field  

One of the jobs I hold is that of a non-profit director. I have spent time in many countries including Africa, where I laid hands on a man with Yellow Fever. As I prayed, I felt intense heat surge through my arm into his body. He cried out, *“It’s hot, it’s hot!”* Fifteen minutes later he was sitting up in his hospital bed because the fever had broken, and he was laughing with his daughter.  

These miracles are powerful, but they only happen when we step into our identity and authority as children of the Most High God, knowing that Jesus has won a victory and given us authority over the principalities and powers.:  

- “And has made us kings and priests to His God and Father.” (Revelation 1:6 NKJV)  
- “And raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.” (Ephesians 2:6 NKJV)  

We are not beggars hoping for scraps—we are sons and daughters, invited to rule and reign with Him in love.

## Discernment in an Age of Deception  

I know there are many teachers today with theories, and some overlap with what I’ve written about Yahweh. I value voices, but I also caution: **not every story is truth**. Some deceptions are seeded by an enemy who would love to rob us of resurrection faith.  

The Knights Templar, guardians of Yahweh’s secrets, may have even staged deceptions—presenting false relics to undermine belief in Jesus’ resurrection. But truth is discerned in the Spirit, not in museums.  Resurrection power is seen in lives changed and power manifested.

## Writing, Dreams, and Revelation  

Twenty years ago, I wrote *Snatchproof: The Art of Hearing God’s Voice*.  

![Snatchproof Book Cover](/images/snatchproof.png)

It’s the story of how I learned to hear God's voice. It was my first book and the publishing company wasn't fantastic. I make something like .50 every time a book is sold, but that is okay. The message is valuable and helpful for anyone learning to hear God's voice. It is still on Amazon, even in Spanish. It’s a practical guide to hearing Him clearly.  The book came from a 20 year long journey in searching how to hear God's voice and discern between my own, the enemy's and God's. 

More recently, I wrote *The Yahweh Deception*. That book began with a real night-time dream where Jesus appeared and spoke to me. He highlighted numbers—2, 3, 4, 5. Three, He said, was like a stable stool. I woke up at 3:33 AM. From then on, the numbers followed me everywhere—$5.55 balances, 2:22 on the clock—encouragements that I wasn’t imagining things as I researched difficult truths.  The *Yahweh Deception* tells that story in detail.

What I discovered: **Jesus revealed Abba—not Yahweh—as the Father.**  
Abba, together with Jesus, created the plan to save humanity from the oppressive powers and principalities.  
Abba is a God of love, freedom and relationship - the Melchizedek priesthood represents this covenant of communion and fellowship with the Father.

Yahweh was a bene elohim, a lesser god, who ruled by fear, law and domination. Saying that he is God is compromising the character of the Father. The two beings are not the same and cannot be reconciled.
This is who we were rescued from.  
This is who lost his jurisdiction.  
This is why we can now walk free of accusation and law.  We are no longer slaves to sin, for sin came that the tresspass may increase. Think of that. Law was introduced to increase sin and accusation. That is fruit from another tree, not the good tree of the Father.

## Conclusion  

Jesus is real. His resurrection is real. Abba is real. And His kingdom of freedom is real.

This is the good news: we are no longer enslaved. We are invited into relationship with a loving Father, freed by the resurrected Christ.
