# Welcome to Abba Unveiled

When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He began with a single, radical word: **Abba.**  

It was not the distant, fearful title many expected for God‚Äîit was intimate, relational, like a child saying, *‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù* That one word revealed the heart of the Father in a way that challenged everything religious systems had built.  

You may have found this website through my book, *The Yahweh Deception.* I invite you to browse the blogs and articles here as I continue to grow this space into a resource for those seeking to know who Jesus‚Äôs Father truly is.

## The Purpose of Abba Unveiled  

This website exists to explore that revelation more deeply. Here you‚Äôll find two central threads woven together:  

### 1. The Journey of Intimacy with the Father  

At its core, *Abba Unveiled* is about drawing near to the One Jesus came to reveal. It‚Äôs about peeling back layers of fear, distortion, and misunderstanding to discover the Father who heals, restores, and welcomes us into relationship.  

You‚Äôll find reflections, spiritual practices, and encouragement for experiencing God not as a distant ruler, but as the ever-present Abba who delights in being known.  

This is the Father whose priest was **Melchizedek**‚ÄîJesus‚Äôs Father and the reason Jesus came in the line of Melchizedek. The priesthood of Melchizedek is a priesthood of relationship, not ritual; of communion, not condemnation. It points us back to the true Father who has always desired connection rather than control.  

### 2. Theological Exploration: Rethinking Yahweh  

Alongside this journey, I‚Äôm sharing my research and writing from my book project, *The Trouble with Yahweh.* This project wrestles with difficult but important questions:  

- Is Yahweh truly the Father Jesus revealed?  
- How have translations, redactions, and centuries of tradition shaped‚Äîor distorted‚Äîour understanding of God‚Äôs name and character?  
- What happens when we measure the actions attributed to Yahweh against the life and teachings of Jesus, the ‚Äúvisible image of the invisible God‚Äù (Colossians 1:15)?  

These aren‚Äôt just academic questions. They matter because our picture of God shapes the way we live, the way we love, and the way we relate to Him.

## Why ‚ÄúUnveiled‚Äù?  

The word *unveiled* carries the sense of removing barriers, lifting blinders, and allowing light to flood in. Many of us have inherited a picture of God clouded by fear, law, or retribution. But the New Testament insists that in Christ, the veil is removed, and we see the Father clearly.  

This site is a space to seek that clarity together.

## What You‚Äôll Find Here  

- Blog posts unpacking theological insights, scriptural studies, and fresh perspectives on ancient texts.  
- Reflections and practices for cultivating intimacy with the Father in daily life.  
- Updates and excerpts from my ongoing book project, inviting you into the process of discovery.  
- Conversations and community for those hungry to know the Father as He truly is.

## A Personal Invitation  

If you‚Äôve ever felt the tension between the God of the Old Testament and the Father Jesus revealed, or if you simply long to go deeper in relationship with Abba, you‚Äôre in the right place.  

Thank you for beginning this journey with me. My prayer is that as we seek truth together, what is unveiled will not only challenge old assumptions but also awaken greater love, trust, and intimacy with the Father.  

**Welcome to Abba Unveiled. Let‚Äôs explore Him together.**
