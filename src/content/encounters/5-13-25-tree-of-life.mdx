I stepped into Heaven this morning by faith and found myself with Yeshua on the balcony of the Courts building. He directed my gaze to the **left of the city**—I’ve always looked straight ahead to the mountains. Off to the left stood a **gigantic tree** in the distance, like something from a fairy tale. The scene had the feeling of the **African Serengeti**—open, warm, alive. He spoke:



<figure className="scripture-center">
  <blockquote>
    “This represents the **Tree of Life**, which you have discovered. The entire Kingdom of God is **based upon relationships** with each other. Here, we operate in **love**, and by loving one another and having **deep fellowship**, nobody is lorded over and no one is harmed.Love the Lord your God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself.
    Everything else falls under that. It is simple. It is beautiful. And, it works.”
  </blockquote>

**My Prayer:**  
*Let that Tree grow in and through me, Lord.*
