One of the most beautiful truths of our walk with God is that heaven is not some far-off place we only experience when we die. Scripture tells us we are *seated with Christ in heavenly places even now*—“and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2:6). That means heaven is accessible to us in this lifetime—and one of the simplest ways to experience it is by stepping in by faith.

## What It Means to Step In

When people talk about “stepping into heaven,” it doesn’t mean floating up through the clouds or waiting for an angel to carry you away. It’s an act of faith. *“For we walk by faith, not by sight”* (2 Corinthians 5:7).

Typically, you close your eyes, quiet your heart, and picture yourself stepping into the heavenly realm. At first, all you see is blackness. That’s where your imagination engages. You begin to “see” in your spirit.  

Some people wonder: *Am I just making this up in my head, or is this actually happening?*  

The answer may be simpler than we think. The mind does not always differentiate between what is “imagined” and what is “real.” But I believe that when your spirit is alive in Christ, it truly perceives heaven—and your imagination is the screen that plays back what your spirit is seeing. Paul wrote: *“We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen”* (2 Corinthians 4:18).

## When Heaven Confirms

One of the greatest confirmations is when multiple people step into heaven together and see the same thing.  

In our Courts of Heaven team with Ron Horner Ministries, we once stepped in to see a PTSD center that heaven was opening. Immediately, I saw a grand staircase leading to five portals—rooms with different environments for healing. One looked like an ocean, another like a cozy cabin.  

I said nothing at first, but soon others began describing the exact same staircase and portals. That confirmed to me this wasn’t imagination—it was a shared reality in the spirit. Jesus said, *“Where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them”* (Matthew 18:20). When believers see the same thing in His presence, it carries weight.  

Another time, I encountered a heavenly being I nicknamed “Jennifer,” a receptionist at the Mercy Court. She had distinct, unusual characteristics—especially her hair—that made me realize she wasn’t human. Later, a friend described her in the exact same way, without me ever mentioning it. Encounters like this echo Hebrews 12:22, where we are told we have *“come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels.”*

## Is It Real, or Just Pictures?

Here’s the ongoing question: are we seeing something that is literally present in heaven, or is heaven communicating to us through pictures—the language of the spirit?  

It may be both. Even if heaven is using imagery as a language, it is still real communication from the Father. But when multiple people see the same thing, it strongly suggests there is a tangible reality in the spirit we are accessing together.

## Why Faith Is the Key

At the end of the day, stepping into heaven is an act of faith. The way of our age—the way God has opened for us to connect with Him—is through trust. *“Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him”* (Hebrews 11:6).  

Jesus is the doorway. He said, *“I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture”* (John 10:9). If you are in Him, you are already entangled with heaven. Your spirit has access, and heaven expects you to come. When you step in, you’re not intruding—you’re responding to your inheritance as a son or daughter of God.

## A Prayer Activation

If this is new to you, here’s a simple way to begin:  

*Father, I thank You that I am seated with Christ in heavenly places. By faith, I choose to step in right now. I close my eyes and fix my heart on You. Jesus, You are the door, and I step through You into the heavenly realm. Open my spiritual eyes and ears to perceive what You are showing me. I receive this by faith, and I trust You to lead me into deeper encounters with Your presence.*  

Now, see yourself stepping through a portal and walking right into Heaven. Take a few minutes to see what comes to your imagination. Don’t dismiss it too quickly. Write it down. Green grass? Children playing? A sandy beach and an ocean? A civic building? Who is there? Can you have a conversation with them? Make notes. Write these encounters down. The biggest obstacle is your own self-doubt or the worry that you are just making things up. Practice. Go with it. If you hear or see anything that does not seem of God, just relax and reset. Sometimes our subconscious needs to shed worries and fear. If it does not sound like the character of Jesus, release it and let it go without condemnation. Just practice and you'll start to have meaningful encounters.

## Takeaway
 
Stepping into heaven is not reserved for mystics or “super-spiritual” people. It’s for every believer willing to trust, engage their imagination, and believe by faith that what they see is truly a glimpse into the eternal realm.
It is a way to grow in faith, to have experiences with Heaven, and to grow spiritually.
