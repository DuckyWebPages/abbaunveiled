Journal Entry 05/01/24

I have been reading and working through Dr. Ron Horner's book on Freemasonry. I started to go through the prayer on page 303 of the book—the courtroom scenario. I was awaiting the verdict, and **Abba Father**, who was the Judge, told me to come to Him and sit on His lap.

With **angelic assistance**, I hopped up the steps and sat on His lap, leaning into Him. My appearance was like a little girl. I wrapped my arms around His neck and began to **sob**—a deep release as the goodness of the Father washed over me. I cried for a while in the earthly realm and let the stress go. I was feeling His literal goodness.

> **Me:** “Abba, this is so hard. This journey—learning this from You in the spirit, instead of from man.”
>
> **Abba:** “You are blazing trails, little one, that others may come this way. **Seals are being broken** from ancient scrolls. **Knowledge that has been held back is being poured out** onto the earth. The time has come for people to **know Me as their Father** and to know the deception and lies they have been under.
>
> Yeshua and I always intended for you all to **grow and learn and lean on Us**, and to become **a royal family throughout the universe**. You are a people patterned after Ourselves. **You have the light of life within you** that other creation does not have. **We are within you.** When We covenant together, **We are entangled**. There is no place you can go that We cannot find you.
>
> We will **train you and show you how to rule and reign**, how to create, and how to **think like the Elohim** you are.” (Note, at another time He had explained how when we covenant with Yeshua, we become entangled. Like coffe and cream mixed together cannot be separated. We become one with the Father and Jesus. Therefore, we are called Elohim because of God within us.)

Later that day, I finished page 307 and asked again to sit on the Father’s lap. I leaned into Him:

> **Me:** “Abba, I now know that You are good. I love You so much. I am covenanted to Jesus and I know that I am in the family, but I also want You to know I am covenanted to **You**. We are family. You are my Abba.
>
> I want to learn from You and Yeshua how to do all the things You made me to be and do. **Let this journey continue.** I can’t wait to see where it goes. **I trust You. I love You. I honor You.** I’m honored to be family.”

**“Wendy, I have something for you. Look up.”**

There were **three armored angels** standing together.

> **Abba:** “These are **elite, special units** that I am assigning to your **children**. They are **warriors** who will guide their footsteps carefully. They will help keep them on their **golden paths** and help them stay within their **timelines and seasons**.”
>
> **Me:** “Oh, THANK YOU ABBA!”
>
> **Abba:** “I know that is the biggest concern on your heart. I want you to **walk without fear**. Your boys will meet each major thing on their path in time, and their decisions will be guided. They will **walk as sons**, and **I will know them**—and **they will know Me**. You don’t have to worry or fear; **they are in Heaven’s hands**.” His love met my deepest concerns. He knows my deepest desires and needs.

Little by little, the Lord has been **revealing truths**—some small, some big. It takes **courage** to let each truth reshape structures we already held. **Old frameworks are being replaced**, and the new ones **clarify who we are**—and even **who and what we have been fighting** all along. **Scrolls long held for this time are being opened**; this is a **time of revealing for the sons**.

## A Hard Observation about Freemasonry

As a side note, I sense that **freemasonry reveals the secrets of Lucifer and Yahweh** to its members as they ascend ranks—presenting a **composite identity** claimed under many names (e.g., *Adonai*, *Mhahaḥ-Bone*, *Jehovah*, *Hirumtito-Civi-Ky*, *Akarjai-jah*, etc.). It reads like a boast of deception: the self-styled “**lord of light**,” the “**creator**,” the one behind many divine names—**Ra**, **Baal**, **Jehovah**—rolled into one. The claim is **“I am all of them.”**  

I’m recording this as **discernment-in-process**: a working note of what I believe the Father is exposing so that **sons and daughters** can walk in **freedom, clarity, and courage**. I felt the Holy Spirit reveal this to my heart and it helped me to see that Lucifer was claiming with pride, to be Jehovah. And these were secrets once not known to the public. I think we have entered an age where secrets are being pulled back and information and knowledge is not being held back from the sons any more.

> **Note:** These are my personal spiritual notes and discernments. I’m sharing them as part of my journey with Abba for the sake of the sons and daughters who are also seeking clarity and freedom.
