Tensions are rising between the USA and Israel. I have been thinking about how one would respond once your view of the God of Israel has changed. If Yahweh is not the true creator, but rather one who brought the law and judgement and is the 'god of this world' who literally deceives the whole world... How does that change one's support of Israel? Here are my thoughts:
## A Kingdom Way Forward

In the face of escalating tensions and grief, I choose the **Kingdom path**—the way of the **Tree of Life**—over accusation, vengeance, and dehumanization. We affirm the image of God in **Jews and Palestinians**, in **Israelis and Americans**, in friends and **enemies** alike. The Kingdom compels us to **love, honor, and respect** each person, to seek justice that **heals** rather than punishes for punishment’s sake, and to pursue peace that protects the vulnerable.

### Core Convictions
- **People over parties and states.** We bless *people*—Israeli and Palestinian—without granting any government a blank check.
- **Tree of Life ethics.** Our governance and speech must nourish life: truth-telling, mercy, restraint, and protection of civilians.
- **Honor across difference.** We reject antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry. We refuse collective blame and demonization.
- **Enemies included.** Jesus’ way includes loving enemies—seeking creative, dignifying paths that interrupt cycles of harm.

### What We Support (Policy Posture)
- **Civilian protection as a first principle.** Humanitarian access, safeguarded corridors, medical neutrality, and credible casualty accountability.
- **Conditionality with clarity.** U.S. military aid—*to anyone*—should be conditioned on compliance with U.S. law and humanitarian standards, with end-use monitoring.
- **De-escalation + real diplomacy.** Hostage releases, verifiable ceasefire mechanisms, and a political horizon that guarantees rights and security for both peoples.
- **Consistent ethic.** We evaluate all actors by the same life-honoring standard—state or non-state, friend or foe.

### How We Will Speak and Act (Community Practice)
- **Honor in our words.** We will not slander; we will ask honest questions, listen deeply, and refuse propaganda—especially when it flatters our side.
- **Respectful dialogue.** We will create spaces where those who disagree can speak without being shamed or shouted down.
- **Peacemaking generosity.** We give to reputable humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts that serve civilians regardless of side.
- **Intercession.** We pray for enemies and authorities alike; we ask the Father for wisdom that disarms fear and breaks retaliation cycles.

### A Prayer from the Tree of Life
*Father, let our roots go down deep into Your love. Teach us justice that heals, courage that restrains, and language that honors. Make us oaks of righteousness who shelter the weary—Jew and Palestinian, American and neighbor, friend and enemy—until swords become plowshares and accusation loses its voice. Amen.*
