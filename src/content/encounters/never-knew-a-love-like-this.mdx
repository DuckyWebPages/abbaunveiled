*Journal Entry 09/01/25*

My child, there is nothing to fear and nothing to fret. I am here. All you have to do is call on Me, and you will have My immediate attention. I am in you, and you are in Me. I can literally see what you see by looking with you through your eyes. You are never, ever alone.

Tell My children that I am with them at all times. My Spirit dwells within them. Their bodies are temples for Me, for I live inside them. Your physical body has within it a portal into the spirit realm. It is for you alone. Other beings long to look into this, for it is unique to you. Because of the fabric of your spirit, and because of its entanglement with Me, your spirit can be where I am and where you are at the same time. Do not fear this as it is as natural for you as breathing.

This is what fallen beings desire. They covet the part of Me that is in you. They want to connect to Me as though I were a substance and not a Person. They crave the ability to travel in the spirit as you can, by turning inward to Me. They are jealous of this gift. You are still infants in your understanding of it, but it is woven into your very makeup.

Yeshua and I are your family, and each one of you has direct access to us. You are invited into communion with Us. We long for that communion, for relationship. We long to teach you and to train you in the ways of the universe. There is so much to learn! Come, My children. Come.

Imagine your hands in Mine and ask to come to My chambers. Come! Sit at the table with the Seven Spirits of God and with Me. Counsel with the Seven Spirits. Sit with Me and share your heart. Commune with Me, and I will commune with you. See Me in your mind's eye. Release the fear as there is no judgment here. I love you and invite you into fellowship. I invite you into the Kingdom. I invite you to take your place as sons and daughters in My family.

Invite Me into your secret place. Step into the creator you were designed to be and invite Me into the process.

I am in you.  
You are in Me.  
I will love and support you, not judge you.  
I will not be cruel, I am kind in heart. Come to Me and find out. I LOVE you! I love you! I love you! Do you hear that resonate within you?  
I love you. You are at home when you are with Me.  
You are safe with Me.  
Come find out!

## A SONG ABOUT THE FATHER'S LOVE

[Lean Back (feat. Amanda Lindsey Cook & Chandler Moore) â€” Maverick City Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixknfMJt21w)



Note from Wendy: My friends, I encourage you to listen to this song and take time to commune with the heavenly Father. Abba is so good. He has always been good. His character was never compromised. He is loving, kind, gracious and merciful. He is all-powerful but does not weild His power to enslave or suppress. He is love. He is love. Hear me, He is love.

"I thought I knew what love was....  but it's better, it's better."

### LYRICS:

```text
Verse
You will never leave
Your love sustaining me
Before I even knew what love was
You brought me here to rest
Given me space to breathe
So I'll stand still until it sinks in

Chorus
I will lean back in the loving arms of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He's a love like no other

Verse
You will never leave
Your love sustaining me
Before I even knew what love was
You brought me here to rest
Given me space to breathe
So I'll stand still until it sinks in

Chorus
I will lean back in the loving arms of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He's a love like no other

Bridge
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I've seen
I'm breathing deep of all that goodness
Your loving kindness to me

Tag
I thought I knew what love was
But it's better it's better
I thought I knew what love was
It's brighter it's brighter
