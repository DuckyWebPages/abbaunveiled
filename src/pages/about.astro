          <h1>About Abba Unveiled</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            I’m <strong>Wendy Selvig</strong>—a researcher, writer, and storyteller. Abba Unveiled is a website dedicated to pointing people to the amazing, loving, wonderful Father that Jesus revealed in scripture. I don't twist scripture or add to it, I simply point you to see that which is already there. The god of this world has pulled the wool over many people's eyes, including Christians. We have allowed others to dictate truth to us. We gave up our right to think for ourselves. We delegated interpretation to scribes of another religion that doesn't even line up with Christianity. Scribes edited and redacted scriptures all the way back to King Josiah's time. They erased El Elyon's name and wrote in Yahweh in places that can't be denied. Scholars agree this happened. A conflating of the entity Yahweh and El Elyon happened. And when you believe they are the same entity, most Christians don't care. I didn't! But when you discover they are separate, suddenly it matters. Allowing scribes to make theological edits no longer makes sense. Going back to the oldest versions of scriptures is necessary! There is so much we need to discuss, are you ready? The gods of the ancient past were real. They were bene elohim who rightfully ruled over territories and peoples. They were judged by God because they didn't do a good job of it, as they used their power to serve self. Much of the story has been edited and covered over. And, the truth will set you free! Freer than you knew or thought even as a typical Christian! It is very exciting, come along!
            There are scholars who understand this - I will point you to them. I had to stop writing my book at 400 pages because it was getting too long! <em>Jesus came to show us a Father that He said no one had ever seen or heard before. We were legally under Elohim jurisdiction and government. We were in deep trouble, as the enemy of our souls used the law to bring accusation and judgement in - which caused legal slavery. We desperately needed a savior because as Paul said, 'when sin entered, I died.' Sin was used to create a legal right and wrong and give the enemy power to accuse. This legal system of law then was transferred to Rome and on to Europe. It was adopted as Judeo-Christianity around the world, allowing accusation to be the precedent of the whole world. Yahweh, then, as the literal 'god of this world' had power as all of humanity has worshipped him thinking He was the Father. Jesus came to reveal that Yahweh was not the Father. This is why they hated him so much. Jesus never spoke Yahweh's name. He never upheld any of Yahweh's laws. He never endorsed anything Yahweh did. Instead He challenged Yahweh, He challenged the Law, and He said if you had seen Him, You had seen the Father. What characteristic of Yahweh would you say is like Jesus? They are polar opposites. Yahweh murders his enemies, Jesus loves them. Yahweh kills children, Jesus said, "Let them come to me." Yahweh was legalistic and unloving, Jesus fulfilled the law so that the ransom would be paid to the criminal and then could be set aside. Oh, if you haven't considered this, you are in for a ride. Grab your copy of The Yahweh Deception and prepare to have your world turned upside down!</em>

        <h2>What This Project Is</h2>
        <p>
          Abba Unveiled explores theological discussions by well-known scholars, scripture, and lived experience to reveal a well-hidden deception that has veiled the true nature of God for centuries. My goal is to help you see the Father Jesus actually came to reveal. I write about Jesus’s resurrection power, the Melchizedek
          priesthood, and how legalism yields to relationship with Abba.

        <h2>My Story in Brief</h2>
        <p>
          From childhood I experienced Jesus as living and present—healings, guidance, and encounters that
          shaped my faith. I studied at Oral Roberts University, learned to discern His voice, and have
          served on the mission field with my family in Panama and in Africa, where we witnessed provision
          miracles and healings in Jesus’s name.
