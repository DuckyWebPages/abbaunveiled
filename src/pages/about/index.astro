            <h2 id="why">Why Abba Unveiled?</h2>
            <p>For many believers, there’s a quiet tension: the Father that Jesus reveals feels very different from the God described in much of the Old Testament. For years, I carried that same fracture. I trusted Jesus, but when I thought of the Father, I hesitated.</p>
            <p><em>Abba Unveiled</em> was born out of my search to heal that fracture. As I sought Jesus, He led me into answers I didn’t expect—answers that revealed a good, kind, merciful Father who is better than we’ve been told. This site, and my book <em>The Yahweh Deception</em>, exist to lift the veil and invite you into a fresh encounter with Abba.</p>

            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I’m W.R. Selvig—author, podcaster, and lifelong follower of Jesus. For over forty years I’ve pursued Him through prayer, research, and encounters. Some friends call me prophetic; I simply acknowledge I’m a seer. I never planned to write this book—Jesus asked me to share what He showed me so others could find the same healing and freedom.</p>

            <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Theology</strong> that challenges assumptions and lifts veils.</li>
              <li><strong>Spiritual practices</strong> that restore intimacy with the Father.</li>
              <li><strong>Personal encounters</strong> from my journey that may resonate with yours.</li>
              <li><strong>Podcasts &amp; resources</strong> to support your walk with Abba.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>“This isn’t about tearing down faith. It’s about strengthening it—freeing believers from fear and inviting them into the love Jesus always pointed to.”</blockquote>

            <h2>A Time of Unveiling</h2>
            <p>We’re living in a new era of revelation. Across the world, corruption is being exposed—in politics, education, and religion. It’s uncomfortable, but necessary: only when deception is revealed can healing and new structures rise. I believe this unveiling includes the Father’s own character, long obscured by fear and tradition. The bandage is coming off. Sons and daughters are learning to trust Abba again.</p>
