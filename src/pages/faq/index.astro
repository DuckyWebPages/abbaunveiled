        What is Abba Unveiled about?
      </summary>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Abba Unveiled explores the Father that Jesus revealed, contrasting this with the legalistic image of Yahweh.
        It’s about rediscovering relational connection with the Most High rather than rules and fear.

        Yes — I’m working on a multi-volume project tentatively titled <em>The Trouble with Yahweh</em>, which examines
        ancient textual history and the differences between El Elyon and Yahweh. Volume 1 is finished, and Volume 2 is
        underway.
